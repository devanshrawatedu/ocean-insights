# 🌊 Ocean Insights


**Real-time coastal intelligence powered by Copernicus Marine datasets and Gemini AI, with optional email reporting**


## 🧠 What is Ocean Insights?


**Ocean Insights** is a user-friendly web app that combines **Copernicus Marine Service** oceanographic datasets and **Gemini AI** to answer natural language queries about ocean conditions. It also offers optional **email reports** containing detailed data summaries.


## 🚀 Features


- 📍 Search **any coastal location** globally
- 📦 Fetches **real-time marine datasets** (temperature, salinity, currents, chlorophyll, etc.)
- 🤖 Converts raw data into **simple answers** using **Gemini AI**
- 📧 Optionally receive a **detailed report via email**
- 💡 Example questions:
  - Is it safe to swim in Pondicherry today?
  - What are the wave conditions near Mumbai?
  - Are chlorophyll levels high around Goa?

## 📦 Datasets Used


- `cmems_mod_glo_phy_anfc_0.083deg_PT1H-m` → Ocean Physics (temperature, salinity, currents, sea level)
- `cmems_mod_glo_wav_anfc_0.083deg_PT3H-i` → Wave Conditions (significant wave height, mean wave period, mean wave direction)
- `cmems_mod_glo_bgc-optics_anfc_0.25deg_P1D-m` → Biogeochemical Optics (light attenuation coefficient)
- `cmems_mod_glo_bgc-bio_anfc_0.25deg_P1D-m` → Biogeochemical Biology (oxygen)
- `cmems_mod_glo_bgc-nut_anfc_0.25deg_P1D-m` → Biogeochemical Nutrients (nitrates, phosphates)


## 🌍 SDG Alignment


Ocean Insights supports these **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**:


- **SDG 13: Climate Action** — Raising awareness about changing ocean conditions through accessible AI-driven insights.
- **SDG 14: Life Below Water** — Making biogeochemical data (chlorophyll, oxygen, nutrients) understandable to promote ocean literacy.
- **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** — Informing safe coastal activities and promoting resilience in coastal communities.
