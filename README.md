# 🌊 Ocean Insights

**Real-time coastal intelligence powered by Copernicus Marine datasets and Gemini AI**

---

## 🧠 What is Ocean Insights?

Ocean Insights is a lightweight web app that fetches real-time oceanographic and biogeochemical data from the **Copernicus Marine Service** and uses **Gemini AI** to generate easy-to-understand answers for user queries about ocean conditions.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🌍 Search any coastal location in the world
* 📦 Real-time oceanographic data via Copernicus Marine API
* 🤖 Natural language insights generated by Google's Gemini LLM
* 💡 Examples include:

  * Is it safe to swim in Pondicherry today?
  * Can I go surfing near Kochi this morning?
  * How are the chlorophyll levels near Goa?
  * What are the wind and wave patterns off the Chennai coast?
* ✅ Safety-aware and context-rich answers

   ```

3. **Add your credentials**:
   Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with:

   ```toml
   CMEMS_USERNAME = "your_copernicus_username"
   CMEMS_PASSWORD = "your_copernicus_password"
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_google_generative_ai_key"
   ```

   ⚠️ **DO NOT** commit this file to GitHub (already `.gitignored`).

4. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run ocean_insights_app.py
   ```

## 🧪 Datasets Used

This app fetches real-time ocean conditions from the following Copernicus Marine datasets:

* `cmems_mod_glo_phy_anfc_0.083deg_PT1H-m` → Ocean Physics (temperature, salinity, currents)
* `cmems_mod_glo_wav_anfc_0.083deg_PT3H-i` → Wave Conditions (height, period, direction)
* `cmems_mod_glo_wav_anfc_0.083deg_PT1H-i` → Wave Dynamics (wind, wave period)
* `cmems_mod_glo_bgc_anfc_0.25deg_PT1D-m` → Biogeochemistry (chlorophyll, oxygen, nitrates)
